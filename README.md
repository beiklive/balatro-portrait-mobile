A portrait-mode mod for Balatro on Android, built for one-handed play.

> **The build does not apply the portrait mod by default.** As shipped, the build
> packages the game as it is — original landscape layout, original HUD — into the
> rootless APK and the iOS `.ipa`. Pass `--portrait` to build the portrait layout
> mod described below. See [Portrait mod](#portrait-mod-opt-in).

## Features

- **Portrait mode** with a vertical layout rebuilt for one-handed play
- **Touch controls** with anti-jitter, so a shaky tap does not turn into a drag
- **Swipe gestures**: flick a selected card up to play it, down to discard
- **Hand preview**: a floating chip shows the current poker hand (name, level, chips x mult)
- **Redesigned HUD** with thumb-sized targets
- **High refresh rate** matched to your display (90/120 Hz)
- **Diagnostics screen** (Options -> Diagnostics) with a copyable device/layout
  report that drops straight into bug reports
- **Mods** through [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), with optional one-command Steamodded install
- **Save transfer** from desktop Balatro or the official Play app, no root needed
- **Termux builds** with no PC, using the installed Play Store app as the source
- **Zygisk module** (experimental, root only) for the official Google Play install
- **iOS** (experimental) sideloadable `.ipa`

## Which build should I use?

If you are not sure, use the rootless APK builder. It does not need root.

| Path | Best for | Root | What you install |
|------|----------|------|------------------|
| **Rootless APK builder** | Most users | No | A separate `com.unofficial.balatro` portrait APK |
| **Termux phone build** | No PC | No | The same APK, built on the phone |
| **Zygisk module** | Rooted users keeping the official app | Yes | `balatro_portrait.zip` from Releases |
| **iOS** | Testers | No jailbreak | Experimental `.ipa` |

Ready-made rootless APKs are not uploaded here because they contain your own
Balatro files. The Zygisk ZIP only holds the portrait module, so it can live on
the Releases page.

Every path needs a legal copy of Balatro. PC builds also need Python 3.6+;
phone-only builds need Termux (F-Droid or GitHub build).

## Portrait mod (opt in)

`python build.py` packages the game as it ships. To get the portrait layout —
vertical reflow, swipe gestures, hand preview, thumb-sized HUD — build with
`--portrait`:

```sh
python build.py --portrait --ios
```

| | Default (`--no-portrait`) | `--portrait` |
|---|---|---|
| Source packaged | `game_original_files/` — your copy, as extracted | `src/` — the layout mod |
| Orientation | landscape, as the game ships | locked portrait (`Info.plist`, `screenOrientation`) |
| Layout, HUD, controls | untouched | portrait reflow, gestures, hand preview |
| CRT shader | untouched | CRT disabled, edge mask follows the slider |
| iOS native-scale drawable (#45) | kept | kept |
| Android accelerometer gamepad (#44) | kept | kept |

Both modes keep the edits that are not about portrait layout and that the game
needs to behave on a phone at all — the iOS native-scale drawable fix (#45), the
Android accelerometer-as-gamepad fix (#44) and the mod-loader boot screen fit
(#44). The `conf.lua` ones live in `patches/mobile/`.

The iOS native-scale fix needs a second half. `conf.lua` asks for the native
scale, but the boot window rebuild in `functions/button_callbacks.lua` passes
`highdpi = (love.system.getOS() == 'OS X')`, and `updateMode` takes whatever it
is handed — so on iOS the flag is dropped again and the game renders at point
resolution, stretched over the panel and blurry (#45). Because that file is
mostly portrait work it cannot be overlaid wholesale, so `build.py` applies the
one-line iOS arm instead (`_apply_ios_highdpi_patch`).

Nothing in `src/` is removed either way, so `--portrait` still builds exactly
what it did before.

Only `conf.lua` is overlaid. The touch-cursor change in `src/engine/controller.lua`
is not, even though it looks like a plain mobile fix: it only works together with
the touch plumbing portrait adds to `src/main.lua`, which is what sets
`G.CONTROLLER.touch_position.seen`. The shipped `main.lua` has no such field, so
copying the change over leaves the game with a cursor parked offscreen that
nothing ever moves — it renders, but no touch lands on anything.

## Rootless APK builder

Build a portrait APK on Windows, macOS, or Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShaggyLorean/balatro-portrait-mobile.git
cd balatro-portrait-mobile
python build.py
```

The first run asks where Balatro is installed and extracts what it needs. The
APK is written to:

```text
balatro-mobile-maker/balatro-aligned-debugSigned.apk
```

Install it:

```sh
adb install balatro-mobile-maker/balatro-aligned-debugSigned.apk
```

Common options:

```sh
python build.py --keep-crt --readabletro
python build.py --steamodded                       # bundle Steamodded (newest)
python build.py --import-save "%APPDATA%\Balatro"   # bring your save across
python build.py --balatro "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro\Balatro.exe" --force
```

## Phone build (Termux, no PC)

If the official Play Store Balatro is installed, Termux can build the portrait
APK straight from it. No PC copy of `Balatro.exe` or `Game.love` is needed.

1. Install the official Play Store Balatro and launch it once.
2. Install Termux from F-Droid or GitHub.
3. In Termux run `termux-setup-storage`, tap **Allow**, then paste:

```sh
pkg update -y && pkg install -y git && rm -rf balatro-portrait-mobile && git clone https://github.com/ShaggyLorean/balatro-portrait-mobile.git && cd balatro-portrait-mobile && bash termux-build.sh --force
```

The helper installs what it needs, asks about Readabletro and CRT, then builds
and signs the APK. It is copied to `/sdcard/Download/balatro-portrait-mobile.apk`.

Full guide: [docs/TERMUX.md](docs/TERMUX.md).

## Zygisk module (experimental, root only)

This keeps the official Google Play app installed and injects portrait mode at
launch. It does not patch or re-sign the APK, but it needs root + Zygisk and is
arm64 only. It does not provide Lovely mods; that is the rootless build's job.

1. Install the official Play Store Balatro and launch it once.
2. Download `balatro_portrait.zip` from GitHub Releases.
3. Flash the ZIP from KernelSU, Magisk, or APatch.
4. Pick Readabletro/CRT options during install.
5. Reboot and launch the official Balatro app.

More details: [zygisk/README.md](zygisk/README.md).

## iOS (experimental, testers wanted)

Build with `--ios`, then sideload `balatro-portrait.ipa` with
[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or [AltStore](https://altstore.io/). Full
guide: [docs/IOS.md](docs/IOS.md).

`--ios` is an **iOS-only** build: the Android APK step is skipped, so no APK is
written and none of the Android tooling (JDK, apktool, uber-apk-signer) is
downloaded — Python 3.6+ and a network connection are all it needs. Pass
`--with-apk` to package the APK in the same run.

The notch / Dynamic Island inset (v2.6.4) and the home-indicator inset
(v2.7.0) are read from the device at runtime, but this project is developed
without an iPhone, so none of it is verified on real hardware. If the layout
still looks off on yours, `src/portrait_config.lua` has two knobs:
`safe_area_extra_ios` (more gap under the island) and
`safe_area_bottom_extra_ios` (more gap above the swipe bar).

**Testing takes five minutes and helps a lot.** [Open an issue](https://github.com/ShaggyLorean/balatro-portrait-mobile/issues)
with:

- your device model and iOS version
- a screenshot of the title screen and one mid-run
- anything clipped, overlapped, or unreachable

## Mods

The Android build ships with Lovely, so it can run mods. Most mods need
Steamodded, and the build can fetch and bundle it for you:

```sh
python build.py --steamodded          # newest Steamodded
python build.py --steamodded <tag>    # a specific release
```

A bundled mod installs itself on the first launch. Restart the game once and it
is active.

To add other mods by hand, put each one in the app's `Mods/` folder:

1. Launch the game once, then close it.
2. Install [Material Files](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files).
3. Menu -> **Add storage** -> **External storage** -> pick the **Balatro** app
   -> **Use this folder**.
4. Put the mod folder in `game/Mods/`, then restart.

Root and ADB work too. See [docs/MODDING.md](docs/MODDING.md).

## Save transfer

Carry your unlocks and progression into the portrait app from desktop Balatro or
the official Play Store app (via Google Takeout, no root). The build can bake a
save in, so it is there on first launch:

```sh
python build.py --import-save "%APPDATA%\Balatro"        # desktop save folder
python build.py --import-save takeout-XXXXXXXX-001.zip   # official-app export
```

Full walkthrough, including the manual copy route: [docs/SAVE_TRANSFER.md](docs/SAVE_TRANSFER.md).

## Troubleshooting

**Game will not start.** Make sure the first-run extraction finished;
`src/resources/` and `src/localization/` must exist. Re-run `python build.py`.

**Build fails.** Check `python --version` (3.6+ required). The JDK and build
tools download automatically on the first build (about 250 MB), so you need an
internet connection.

**Black ellipse or colored sliver at the bottom.** The CRT shader can cause this
in portrait on some devices. Rebuild with `python build.py --disable-crt`, or
answer **yes** to "Disable the CRT shader?" in the interactive build.

**Something looks misplaced or cut off.** Open **Options -> Diagnostics** in
game, tap **Copy to clipboard**, and paste the report into your issue — it
carries the exact screen and safe-area numbers of your device.

Path-specific problems are covered in their own guides:
[Zygisk](zygisk/README.md) · [Termux](docs/TERMUX.md) · [iOS](docs/IOS.md) ·
[Modding](docs/MODDING.md) · [Save transfer](docs/SAVE_TRANSFER.md)
