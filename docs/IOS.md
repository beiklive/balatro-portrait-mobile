# iOS Build (EXPERIMENTAL)

> **Status: experimental and untested by the maintainer** (no iOS device available).
> The build pipeline is sound, it mirrors how
> [balatro-mobile-maker](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker) builds
> its iOS package, but layout, safe-area/notch behavior, and performance on real
> devices have not been verified. If you try it, **please
> [open an issue](https://github.com/ShaggyLorean/balatro-portrait-mobile/issues)**
> with your device model and screenshots, working or not. We'll help you debug.

## How it works

There is no Xcode and no macOS involved. The build:

1. Downloads a prebuilt, unsigned LÖVE iOS app shell with lovely-injector
   linked into it (`base.ipa` from
   [Lovely Mobile Maker](https://lmm.shorty.systems/), contains **no game
   data**). `--ios-vanilla` uses the plain shell instead
   (`balatro-base.ipa` from [balatro-apk-maker](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-apk-maker)'s
   Additional Tools, SHA-256 verified), which is what every build before
   v2.7.7 used
2. Inserts your locally built `Game.love` (made from **your** copy of Balatro)
   into `Payload/Balatro.app/`
3. Sets the `Info.plist` orientation — landscape-locked by default,
   portrait-locked with `--portrait` — stamps the mod version and opts the app
   into the panel's full refresh rate
4. Writes `balatro-portrait.ipa`

Since v2.7.6 the window also asks for the screen's native scale. Without it
iOS handed LOVE a drawable the size of the window in points and stretched it
over the panel, so an iPhone 13 Pro drew the whole game at 390x844 and blew it
up to 1170x2532 (#45). Android was never affected: it takes its scale from the
display density instead of that flag.

The IPA is **unsigned by design**. Sideloading tools re-sign it with your own
Apple ID at install time.

## Building

```
python build.py --ios
```

Or answer **yes** to "Build iOS .ipa?" during the interactive build.
The output is `balatro-portrait.ipa` in the project root.

`--ios` builds **only** the IPA. The Android APK step is skipped, so no APK is
written and none of the Android tooling (JDK, apktool, uber-apk-signer) is
downloaded: Python 3.6+ and a network connection are all the build needs. Steps 1
and 2 still run, because the IPA needs `Game.love` and the game resources it is
packed from. Pass `--with-apk` if you want the APK packaged in the same run.

### Portrait, or as shipped

The build does **not** apply the portrait mod unless you ask for it, so
`python build.py --ios` produces the game with its original landscape layout and
the two landscape orientations declared in `Info.plist`. Add `--portrait` for the
portrait mod, which pins `Info.plist` to portrait:

```
python build.py --ios --portrait
```

Either way the IPA keeps the mobile platform fixes that are not about portrait
layout — the iOS native-scale drawable (#45), the Android accelerometer gamepad
fix (#44) and the mod-loader boot screen fit (#44). The portrait-only shader work
and the portrait layout are what `--portrait` adds.

The native-scale fix has two halves. `conf.lua` asks for the native scale, but the
game rebuilds its window once at boot in `functions/button_callbacks.lua` and only
keeps the flag on macOS (`highdpi = (love.system.getOS() == 'OS X')`). iOS was
missing from that test, so the drawable fell back to point size and the panel
stretched it — a whole-screen blur. The build applies the iOS arm to that line;
without it the IPA looks soft no matter what `conf.lua` says.

### Mods

Since v2.7.7 the IPA is built on a shell that has lovely-injector in it, so
Steamodded loads the same way it does on Android. Earlier builds used a plain
LÖVE shell with no mod loader, which is why mods could not be made to work with
them (#45).

Put mods where the
[Steamodded mobile guide](https://docs.smods.dev/Installation/Installing%20Steamodded%20mobile/)
says: open the **Files** app, go to **On My iPhone → Balatro → game → Mods**
and drop `smods` in there. The bundle id is unchanged, so this installs over an
earlier build and keeps its saves.

Portrait keeps the vanilla lines that Steamodded's patches anchor on, which is
what makes the two work together on Android; the same source is what goes into
the IPA. None of this is tested on a device by the maintainer, so report back.
Use `--ios-vanilla` for the old plain shell.

## Sideloading

You need a free Apple ID. Two common options:

### Sideloadly (Windows/macOS)

1. Install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)
2. Connect your iPhone/iPad via USB
3. Drag `balatro-portrait.ipa` into Sideloadly
4. Enter your Apple ID and press **Start**
5. On the device: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management** → trust your
   developer certificate

### AltStore (Windows/macOS)

1. Install [AltServer](https://altstore.io/) on your computer and AltStore on
   your device
2. Open the IPA with AltStore (**My Apps → + → balatro-portrait.ipa**)

### The 7-day limit

With a free Apple ID, sideloaded apps expire after **7 days** and must be
re-signed (re-install via Sideloadly, or let AltStore auto-refresh in the
background). A paid Apple Developer account extends this to a year. Your save
data survives re-signing as long as you don't delete the app.

## Known unknowns (testers wanted)

- **Notch/Dynamic Island overlap**, the top inset is read from the device at
  runtime since v2.6.4; `safe_area_extra_ios` in `src/portrait_config.lua` adds
  extra gap if the HUD still hugs the island
- **Home indicator**, the bottom inset is read at runtime since v2.7.0 so the
  title-screen buttons clear the swipe bar; `safe_area_bottom_extra_ios` in
  `src/portrait_config.lua` adds extra gap. If something still looks off,
  attach the **Options -> Diagnostics** report to your issue
- **Rounded display corners**, iOS leaves these out of the safe area it
  reports, so since v2.7.6 the two title-screen corner buttons step up and in
  on any device with a home indicator (`corner_lift_ios` and
  `corner_inset_ios` under `main_menu` in `src/portrait_config.lua`)
- **High refresh rate**, still open. The IPA carries
  `CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone` since v2.7.6, which is the key iOS
  documents for going past 60 Hz, but the one ProMotion report so far (#45)
  still reads 60 on the lovely shell and "feels like 60" on the plain one.
  Since v2.7.8 the **Options -> Diagnostics** report shows the refresh rate the
  app is told the panel has and the cap the frame loop is using; if you have a
  120 Hz iPhone, that report is what settles it
- **Haptics**, `love.system.vibrate` support varies on iOS; worst case it's a
  silent no-op
- **Performance**, the CRT shader may behave differently on Apple GPUs; if you
  see artifacts, rebuild with `--disable-crt`

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to install" / signing errors
Free Apple IDs are limited to 3 sideloaded apps and ~10 app IDs per week.
Remove an old app or wait, then retry.

### Game opens in landscape or letterboxed
This shouldn't happen (orientation is locked in `Info.plist`), if it does,
open an issue with a screenshot; that's exactly the feedback we need.

### Game crashes on launch
Re-run `python build.py --ios --force` to rule out a stale `Game.love`, and
check that the first-run resource extraction completed (`src/resources/` must
exist). If it still crashes, open an issue with your device and iOS version.
